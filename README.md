Abstract—Summarizing a body of information is a complex
task which mainly depends on the ability to distinguish important
information and to condense notions through abstraction. Con-
sidering a knowledge representation partially ordering concepts
into a directed acyclic graph, this study focuses on the problem of
summarizing several human descriptions expressed through sets
of concepts. We formally define the problem of summarization
in this context and we propose a model mimicking a Human-
like Intelligence for scoring alternatives with regard to a specific
objective. Several interesting theoretical results related to this
problem (e.g. for optimization) are also given. Finally, the evalu-
ation of the proposed approach performed in the domain of odor
analysis highlights the benefits of our proposal and shows how it
could be used to automatize time-consuming expert summarizing
processes. Source code implementing the proposed approach as
well as datasets are made available to the community
